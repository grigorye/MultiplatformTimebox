# Timebox

## Why

- I recently discovered the concept of time-boxing and now try to employ it in my daily life.
- I probably need yet another pet project to experiment with automation, modularization, architectures, Swift UI, and some other promising stuff.

## Credits

All the credits go to the [Zonebox](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/zonebox/id597870795?l=en&mt=12) app, which is the main inspiration for the implementation.

## Highlights

- Swift UI. Humble experiments.

- Modularization. DI, visibility, common patterns?

- Tuist. Xcodegen alternative?

- GitHub actions. Are they better than Jenkins?

- Self-hosted GitHub action runners. Can they be fully automated?

- Targeting both iOS and macOS. Does it make sense?

- Swift Packages. Limitations?

- Universal build numbers. It just makes sense.

- Core Data. How alien is it nowadays?

- iCloud storage. Why not?

- Automated App Store/TestFlight distribution. It just makes sense.

- Ditching Fastlane. As it's slow and bulky.

- Data synchronization/merging/conflict resolution. Always interesting stuff.

- Overlay over macOS menu bar. It looks cool. (Again, credits go to the Zonebox app).
